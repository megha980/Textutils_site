Get and Post request

when you have to send any data securly like user credentials then we use post request instead get .
and get reuest has some limit for sending data if that incraeses error (414 url is too long) will 
occured so we use post request


how to send post reuest:

1. in views.py file 
djtext = request.POST.get('text','default')
and change other GET into POST

2. index.html
change form method in post

** check CSRF(cross site request forgery) mechanism from internet
CSRF token to check that request is coming from your site only

To get CSRF token
1. go in index.html file
in form tag 
<form action="/analyze" method='post'> {% csrf_token %}
